# GemOriginTrace: Blockchain-Based Jewelry Origin Tracking

## Project Overview

GemOriginTrace is a Web3 project built on the Stacks blockchain using Clarity smart contracts. It provides a decentralized solution for tracking the origin and supply chain of diamonds and gold, addressing real-world problems in the jewelry industry such as:

- **Ethical Sourcing and Conflict Minerals**: Consumers increasingly demand transparency to avoid "blood diamonds" or unethically sourced gold. This project ensures immutable records of origin, certifications (e.g., Kimberley Process for diamonds), and ethical mining practices.
- **Counterfeit Prevention**: By tokenizing physical assets as NFTs (for unique diamonds) or fungible tokens (for gold batches), it verifies authenticity and prevents fraud in the supply chain.
- **Supply Chain Opacity**: Traditional systems lack trust and auditability. Blockchain enables end-to-end tracking from mine to store, reducing disputes and enabling regulatory compliance.
- **Integration with Existing Stores**: Jewelers can seamlessly integrate this into their online stores via APIs or dApps, allowing customers to scan a QR code or enter a token ID to view the full blockchain-tracked history.

The system works as follows:
- Miners/suppliers register origins on-chain.
- Manufacturers and jewelers update the chain of custody during processing and sales.
- Customers query the blockchain via a website integrated into the jeweler's store to verify details.
- All data is immutable, publicly verifiable, and secured on Stacks (leveraging Bitcoin's security).

This project involves 6 solid smart contracts written in Clarity, designed for security, efficiency, and composability. It uses Stacks' SIP-009 (NFT) and SIP-010 (FT) standards where applicable.

## Tech Stack
- **Blockchain**: Stacks (for Clarity contracts, Bitcoin-anchored security).
- **Smart Contract Language**: Clarity (decidable, secure, no reentrancy issues).
- **Frontend Integration**: A sample dApp or API (not included here) can be built with JavaScript libraries like @stacks/connect for querying contracts.
- **Deployment**: Use Stacks' testnet/mainnet via Clarinet or Stacks CLI.
- **Dependencies**: None external; all contracts are self-contained.

## Smart Contracts

The project consists of the following 6 Clarity smart contracts, each handling a specific aspect of the system. They interact via public functions and traits for modularity.

### 1. GemToken.clar (NFT/FT Token Contract)
This contract defines tokens representing physical gems:
- Diamonds as NFTs (unique identifiers).
- Gold as FTs (batches with weight/quantity).
It implements SIP-009 for NFTs and SIP-010 for FTs, allowing minting by authorized parties and transfers with custody updates.

Key Functions:
- `mint-diamond-nft (owner: principal, metadata: (tuple ...))`: Mints an NFT for a diamond.
- `mint-gold-ft (owner: principal, amount: uint, metadata: (tuple ...))`: Mints FTs for gold batches.
- `transfer`: Overrides standard transfer to require custody update.

```clarity
;; GemToken.clar
(define-trait gem-token-trait
  ((mint-nft (principal (tuple (origin: (string-ascii 256)) ...)) -> (response uint uint))
   (transfer-nft (uint principal principal) -> (response bool uint))))

(define-non-fungible-token diamond-nft uint)
(define-fungible-token gold-ft uint)

(define-data-var last-nft-id uint u0)
(define-data-var admin principal tx-sender)

(define-public (mint-diamond-nft (owner principal) (metadata (tuple (origin (string-ascii 256)) (certification (string-ascii 256)))))
  (if (is-eq tx-sender admin)
    (let ((new-id (+ (var-get last-nft-id) u1)))
      (try! (nft-mint? diamond-nft new-id owner))
      (var-set last-nft-id new-id)
      (ok new-id))
    (err u401)))  ;; Unauthorized

;; Similar for gold-ft mint and transfers...
```

### 2. OriginRegistry.clar (Origin Registration Contract)
Handles registration of initial origin data by verified suppliers (e.g., mines). Uses oracles or admin roles for verification. Stores immutable origin details like mine location, ethical certifications, and timestamps.

Key Functions:
- `register-origin (gem-id: uint, origin-data: (tuple ...))`: Registers data for a gem token.
- `get-origin (gem-id: uint)`: Public read-only query.

```clarity
;; OriginRegistry.clar
(define-map origins uint (tuple (mine-location (string-ascii 256)) (cert-type (string-ascii 64)) (timestamp uint) (supplier principal)))

(define-data-var admin principal tx-sender)

(define-public (register-origin (gem-id uint) (data (tuple (mine-location (string-ascii 256)) ...)))
  (if (is-eq tx-sender admin)  ;; Or use oracle trait
    (ok (map-set origins gem-id data))
    (err u401)))

(define-readonly (get-origin (gem-id uint))
  (map-get? origins gem-id))
```

### 3. ChainOfCustody.clar (Supply Chain Tracking Contract)
Tracks transfers and updates in the supply chain (e.g., from mine to cutter to jeweler). Each transfer appends to a list of custody events, ensuring traceability.

Key Functions:
- `record-transfer (gem-id: uint, from: principal, to: principal, event-data: (tuple ...))`: Appends a custody event.
- `get-custody-history (gem-id: uint)`: Returns the full chain.

```clarity
;; ChainOfCustody.clar
(define-map custody-history uint (list 100 (tuple (from principal) (to principal) (timestamp uint) (event-type (string-ascii 64)))))

(define-public (record-transfer (gem-id uint) (from principal) (to principal) (event-data (tuple (event-type (string-ascii 64)))))
  (match (map-get? custody-history gem-id)
    history (ok (map-set custody-history gem-id (append history (merge event-data (tuple (from from) (to to) (timestamp block-height)))))
    (ok (map-set custody-history gem-id (list (merge event-data (tuple (from from) (to to) (timestamp block-height)))))))

(define-readonly (get-custody-history (gem-id uint))
  (default-to (list) (map-get? custody-history gem-id)))
```

### 4. VerificationOracle.clar (Verification and Oracle Contract)
Integrates off-chain verifications (e.g., lab certifications) via oracles. Allows updating verification status only by trusted oracles.

Key Functions:
- `verify-gem (gem-id: uint, status: bool, details: (string-ascii 256))`: Oracle-only update.
- `is-verified (gem-id: uint)`: Public query.

```clarity
;; VerificationOracle.clar
(define-map verifications uint (tuple (status bool) (details (string-ascii 256)) (oracle principal)))

(define-data-var oracle principal tx-sender)

(define-public (verify-gem (gem-id uint) (status bool) (details (string-ascii 256)))
  (if (is-eq tx-sender oracle)
    (ok (map-set verifications gem-id (tuple (status status) (details details) (oracle tx-sender))))
    (err u401)))

(define-readonly (is-verified (gem-id uint))
  (match (map-get? verifications gem-id)
    data (get status data)
    false))
```

### 5. JewelerIntegration.clar (Integration for Jewelers)
Enables jewelers to mint tokens, link to physical products, and generate query links for their stores. Includes role-based access for jewelers.

Key Functions:
- `register-jeweler (jeweler: principal)`: Admin approves jewelers.
- `create-product-link (gem-id: uint, store-url: (string-ascii 256))`: Links to online store.

```clarity
;; JewelerIntegration.clar
(define-map jewelers principal bool)
(define-map product-links uint (string-ascii 256))

(define-data-var admin principal tx-sender)

(define-public (register-jeweler (jeweler principal))
  (if (is-eq tx-sender admin)
    (ok (map-set jewelers jeweler true))
    (err u401)))

(define-public (create-product-link (gem-id uint) (store-url (string-ascii 256)))
  (if (default-to false (map-get? jewelers tx-sender))
    (ok (map-set product-links gem-id store-url))
    (err u403)))  ;; Not a jeweler

(define-readonly (get-product-link (gem-id uint))
  (map-get? product-links gem-id))
```

### 6. CustomerQuery.clar (Query and Access Contract)
Provides public interfaces for customers to query all data in one place. Aggregates data from other contracts for easy website integration.

Key Functions:
- `query-gem-details (gem-id: uint)`: Returns origin, custody, verification, etc.
- `verify-authenticity (gem-id: uint)`: Combines checks.

```clarity
;; CustomerQuery.clar
(use-trait gem-token-trait .GemToken.gem-token-trait)
;; Assume imports for other contracts

(define-readonly (query-gem-details (gem-id uint))
  (let ((origin (unwrap-panic (.OriginRegistry.get-origin gem-id)))
        (history (.ChainOfCustody.get-custody-history gem-id))
        (verified (.VerificationOracle.is-verified gem-id))
        (link (.JewelerIntegration.get-product-link gem-id)))
    (ok (tuple (origin origin) (history history) (verified verified) (link link)))))
```

## Deployment and Usage
1. Install Clarinet: `cargo install clarinet`.
2. Create a new project: `clarinet new gem-origin-trace`.
3. Add the .clar files to `contracts/`.
4. Test: `clarinet test`.
5. Deploy to testnet: Use Stacks Explorer or CLI.
6. Integrate with Website: Use @stacks/transactions to call `query-gem-details` and display in a UI.

## Security Considerations
- Admin roles are initial; transition to DAO for decentralization.
- All functions use access controls to prevent unauthorized actions.
- Clarity's decidability ensures no infinite loops or surprises.

## Future Enhancements
- Integrate with IPFS for detailed metadata storage.
- Add DAO governance for oracle management.
- Support for more assets (e.g., other gems).

This project empowers consumers with trust in their purchases while helping jewelers differentiate through transparency. Contributions welcome!
